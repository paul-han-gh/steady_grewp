        <p class="font-sans tracking-tight text-slate-900 mb-2">A colleague and I recently discussed what at first seemed like a question with an obvious answer:</p><blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4"><p class="font-sans tracking-tight text-slate-900 mb-2">What <strong>kind</strong> of software is dbt in your data stack?</p></blockquote><p class="font-sans tracking-tight text-slate-900 mb-2">This colleague's answer was &quot;a transformation tool&quot; to which I rebutted &quot;no, it's an orchestrator&quot;. What my research (albeit very shallow) revealed is that my colleague's answer is the widely accepted one.</p><p class="font-sans tracking-tight text-slate-900 mb-2">Whether it's pride or a rigid pursuit for accuracy, I don't agree with the popular assessment of what the data engineering community dubs the role of dbt in a data stack. So, here's my case.</p><h2 class="font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-4 text-3xl">What even is &quot;a transformation tool&quot;?<h2><p class="font-sans tracking-tight text-slate-900 mb-2">My conjecture is that dbt itself coined and popularized the term &quot;transformation tool&quot;. Before dbt, ETL operations were done usually under a single platform that covered extraction, transformation and loading.</p><p class="font-sans tracking-tight text-slate-900 mb-2">Taking cues from principles that were being applied to software engineering, the developers of dbt thought that a modern data stack would be better served if monolithic ETL tools were split into microservices; the &quot;T&quot; is its chosen niche. In that sense, it goes without saying that transformation is the primary scope of dbt's concern within the data stack.</p><p class="font-sans tracking-tight text-slate-900 mb-2">This paradigm shift proved to be a huge value add, and now, dbt-like offerings are rearing their heads in troves (e.g. Dataform, Coalesce, SQLMesh).</p>
